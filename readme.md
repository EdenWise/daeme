These scripts are for basic (d)igital (a)udio (e)xtraction and (M)P3/(f)aac encoding (i.e. ripping)—`daeme` is for MP3s (pronounced _day-m_) and `daefe` for MP4s. These scripts are basic wrappers primary thanks here goes to [RipIt](http://www.suwald.com/ripit/news.php) development.

#### Settings

Some settings are better in the RipIt configuration file as their values won't change. What I use:

```
faacopt=-s
dirtemplate="${artist} — ${album}"
playlist=0
eject=1
```
